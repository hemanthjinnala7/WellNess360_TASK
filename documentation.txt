##Spring Boot Application Documentation

## Overview
This Spring Boot application is designed to manage tasks and users. It utilizes H2 as an in-memory database for storing task and user data. The system provides basic CRUD operations for tasks and user management. It also supports user authentication using Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure secure and role-based access.

## Technology Stack
- **Spring Boot**: The backbone framework for building the application.
- **Spring Security**: Handles authentication and authorization for users.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Provides an easy interface to interact with the database using Java Persistence API (JPA).
- **H2 Database**: A lightweight, in-memory database that is ideal for development and testing.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure user authentication, enabling stateless authentication between client and server.

## Application Flow and Design

### 1. **Database Setup (H2)**
The application uses H2 as an in-memory database. This choice simplifies the setup for development purposes, eliminating the need to install a separate database system. The H2 database is configured to run in memory, meaning it will be wiped clean when the application stops, ensuring a fresh state on every start.

#### Key Benefits:
- Ideal for testing and development.
- No need for external database management.
- Provides an easy-to-use web-based console to view and interact with the database (`http://localhost:8080/h2-console`).

### 2. **Authentication and Authorization (Spring Security with JWT)**
One of the primary features of this application is secure user authentication and authorization. The application uses Spring Security for managing user login and JWT for maintaining stateless authentication.

#### Flow:
1. **User Login**: When a user logs in with their username and password, the system validates the credentials.
2. **JWT Generation**: Upon successful login, the system generates a JWT token that the user can use for subsequent requests.
3. **Token Validation**: For any protected endpoint, the server checks the validity of the token to ensure that the user is authenticated and authorized.

#### Intuition:
- **Spring Security** handles the intricate parts of authentication and authorization.
- **JWT** ensures that user sessions are stateless, making the system scalable. Instead of storing session data on the server, all relevant information is stored in the token.

### 3. **User Management (CRUD Operations)**
The system allows for basic user management, such as registering a new user, logging in, and storing user data in the H2 database. The password is encrypted using the `BCryptPasswordEncoder` to ensure security.

#### Intuition:
- **Registration**: When a user registers, their password is hashed using BCrypt to ensure it’s securely stored in the database.
- **Login**: The application uses the username to retrieve the user from the database and validates the password against the stored hash.
- **JWT-based Authentication**: After successful login, a JWT is issued, which the user can send in the `Authorization` header for subsequent API requests.

### 4. **Task Management (CRUD Operations)**
The application also allows for managing tasks, which include attributes like title, description, status, and due date. Each task is stored in the database and can be created, retrieved, updated, or deleted.

#### Intuition:
- **Task Model**: The task data is stored as an entity in the database. It has basic attributes like title, description, status, and timestamps for tracking task creation and updates.
- **CRUD Operations**: Standard CRUD operations allow users to manage tasks, while Spring Data JPA simplifies database interaction, ensuring that you don’t need to manually write SQL queries.

### 5. **Security Configuration**
To protect the application, security is configured to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints. The system uses a combination of JWT and Spring Security’s user details service for authentication.

#### Intuition:
- **UserDetailsService**: This service loads user details from the database based on the username provided. If the username exists, it returns the user’s details; otherwise, an exception is thrown.
- **Security Filters**: The `SecurityConfig` class is responsible for defining how the application handles security, specifying which routes are open (e.g., login and registration) and which are protected (e.g., task management).

## Key Concepts and Design Decisions

### 1. **Spring Security and JWT**
Spring Security is used to handle user authentication and authorization. The choice of **JWT** for maintaining a stateless session means that we do not need to store user information on the server. Instead, the user is provided with a token that contains all necessary information for each request. This approach enhances scalability and reduces server load, as it does not need to track user sessions.

### 2. **BCrypt Password Encoding**
The application uses **BCryptPasswordEncoder** to securely encode passwords before storing them in the database. BCrypt is a widely used hashing algorithm that ensures passwords are securely stored and prevents attackers from retrieving the original password even if they gain access to the database.

### 3. **H2 Database**
The **H2 in-memory database** provides a quick, easy-to-set-up solution for development and testing. It does not require external database setup and is ideal for scenarios where persistence between application runs is not required. However, in production environments, this can be replaced with a more persistent database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

### 4. **UserPrincipal and Authentication**
In Spring Security, the **UserPrincipal** class is a custom implementation of the `UserDetails` interface. This class represents the authenticated user, and it is used to provide Spring Security with information about the user (such as the username, password, and authorities). By implementing this interface, the application can customize how user details are retrieved and managed, enabling features like role-based authorization.

### 5. **JPA and Spring Data**
Using **Spring Data JPA** simplifies database operations. By extending the `JpaRepository` interface, the application gains built-in methods for CRUD operations without having to manually write SQL queries. This significantly reduces boilerplate code and allows the focus to remain on the business logic.

## Running the Application

1. **Building the Application**: Use Maven (`mvn clean install`) or Gradle (`./gradlew build`) to build the application.
2. **Running the Application**: Start the application using Maven (`mvn spring-boot:run`) or Gradle (`./gradlew bootRun`).
3. **Accessing the Application**: The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`. You can access the H2 database console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` to view and interact with the data.

## Conclusion

This Spring Boot application provides a secure and simple environment for managing tasks and users, with built-in authentication and authorization using JWT. By leveraging Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, and H2, it offers an efficient and scalable solution for development purposes. The application can easily be extended to include more advanced features such as role-based access control, email notifications, and more, as per project requirements.
