# Spring Boot Application - WellNess360_Task

## Overview
This Spring Boot application is designed to manage tasks and users. It utilizes H2 as an in-memory database for storing task and user data. The system provides basic CRUD operations for tasks and user management, and it supports secure user authentication using Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure secure and role-based access.

## Technology Stack
- **Spring Boot**: The backbone framework for building the application.
- **Spring Security**: Handles authentication and authorization for users.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Provides an easy interface to interact with the database using Java Persistence API (JPA).
- **H2 Database**: A lightweight, in-memory database that is ideal for development and testing.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure user authentication, enabling stateless authentication between client and server.

## Application Flow and Design

### 1. **Database Setup (H2)**
The application uses H2 as an in-memory database. This choice simplifies the setup for development purposes, eliminating the need to install a separate database system. The H2 database is configured to run in memory, meaning it will be wiped clean when the application stops, ensuring a fresh state on every start.

#### Key Benefits:
- Ideal for testing and development.
- No need for external database management.
- Provides an easy-to-use web-based console to view and interact with the database (`http://localhost:8080/h2-console`).

### 2. **Authentication and Authorization (Spring Security with JWT)**
This application uses Spring Security for user authentication and authorization. After a user logs in with their username and password, the system validates the credentials and issues a JWT token for secure, stateless authentication.

#### Flow:
- **User Login**: User credentials are validated, and a JWT token is generated upon successful login.
- **Token Validation**: The token is used to validate protected API endpoints, ensuring that the user is authenticated and authorized.

### 3. **User Management (CRUD Operations)**
The system allows for basic user management, such as registering a new user, logging in, and securely storing user data in the H2 database. Passwords are hashed using `BCryptPasswordEncoder` for security.

### 4. **Task Management (CRUD Operations)**
The application supports managing tasks with attributes like title, description, status, and due date. Tasks can be created, retrieved, updated, or deleted using standard CRUD operations.

### 5. **Security Configuration**
The application ensures that only authenticated users can access protected endpoints. It uses a combination of JWT and Spring Security for handling authentication and authorization.

## Key Concepts and Design Decisions

### 1. **Spring Security and JWT**
JWT is used for stateless session management, improving scalability by eliminating the need for server-side session storage.

### 2. **BCrypt Password Encoding**
Passwords are hashed using **BCrypt** before being stored in the database, ensuring secure storage and preventing attackers from retrieving plain text passwords.

### 3. **H2 Database**
The application uses the **H2 in-memory database** for development and testing. It provides a quick setup without requiring external database installation.

### 4. **UserPrincipal and Authentication**
**UserPrincipal** represents the authenticated user and is used by Spring Security to manage user details and authentication.

### 5. **JPA and Spring Data**
By extending `JpaRepository`, the application benefits from built-in CRUD operations, simplifying database interaction without the need for writing custom SQL queries.

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- H2 Database Console (if you want to interact with the in-memory database)

### Build and Run
1. **Build the Application**:
   - Using Maven: `mvn clean install`
   - Using Gradle: `./gradlew build`

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Using Maven: `mvn spring-boot:run`
   - Using Gradle: `./gradlew bootRun`

3. **Access the Application**:  
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

4. **Access the H2 Database Console**:  
   You can access the H2 database console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` to view and interact with the in-memory database.

## Conclusion

This Spring Boot application provides a secure and simple environment for managing tasks and users, with built-in authentication and authorization using JWT. By leveraging Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, and H2, it offers an efficient and scalable solution for development purposes.

This application can easily be extended with more advanced features like role-based access control, email notifications, and more.
